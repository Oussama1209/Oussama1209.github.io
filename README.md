## Project Title: COVID-Behavioral-Data-Analysis

### Brief Description:

Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs is a psychological theory that categorizes human needs into a five-level pyramid structure, ranging from basic physiological needs at the bottom to self-actualization at the top. The theory posits that individuals must satisfy lower-level needs (like food, safety, and love) before they can pursue higher-level needs related to self-fulfillment and personal growth.
The research investigates the Covid-19 impact on human behavior in EU countries, assessing its correlation with Maslow's Hierarchy to understand the relevance of the theory in times of crisis. The aim is to decode the relationship between evolving needs during the pandemic and the principles of Maslow's enduring model.

### Technologies Used:
- **Programming Languages:** Python, HTML
- **Databases:** Wikipageviews, AppleMobility, GoogleMobility
- **APIs:** Google Trends API and Wikidata Query Service

### My Contributions:
- **Design and Planning:** 
  - Conceived the project idea focusing on analyzing the shift in Maslow's hierarchy of needs during COVID.
  - Defined the scope of the study, identifying key data sources from Google Trends and Wikidata.
  - Significantly contributed to the web page creation, using HTML for structure and styling, and leveraged GitHub Pages for hosting.

- **Development:** 
  - Implemented web scraping scripts to automate the extraction of relevant data from Google Trends and Wikidata, ensuring comprehensive coverage of the necessary data for the study.

- **Data Analysis/Modeling:** 
  - Processed and cleaned the collected data to ensure accuracy and relevancy for analysis.
  - Conducted a thorough data analysis to investigate the shift in Maslow's hierarchy of needs during the pandemic. Applied statistical methods and data visualization techniques to identify and illustrate trends and patterns for the higher levels of the pyramid.


### Outcome/Impact:

This project provided a comprehensive analysis of the shift in Maslow's hierarchy of needs during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly focusing on the population in EU countries. The data-driven approach, utilizing web scraping from Google Trends and Wikidata, revealed insightful trends and patterns. Notably, the study uncovered a significant shift in all categories of Maslow's pyramid, highlighting an intensification of needs, yet preserving the original hierarchy of the model. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of human behavior in crisis conditions and validate the enduring relevance of Maslow's theoretical framework in modern-day analytics. The project not only enhanced my skills in data analysis, web scraping, and statistical modeling but also provided valuable insights into the psychological impacts of global crises on human needs and behavior.

## Project Title: Mobile-Robot-Navigation

### Project Overview:

The project focuses on creating an environment where a robot navigates through obstacles using global and local navigation techniques. The project involves navigating a robot through an obstacle-laden environment, where it must find and follow the optimal path to a target using only vision. It incorporates precise motion control and pose estimation through Kalman filtering and employs local navigation strategies to dynamically avoid undetected physical obstacles.

### Technologies Used:
- **Programming Languages:** Python

- **Frameworks/Libraries:**
  - ArUco Library (for marker detection)
  - OpenCV (for computer vision tasks)

- **Tools & Platforms:**
  - Jupyter Notebook (for documentation and report compilation)
  - Git (for version control and collaboration)

- **Sensors and Hardware:**
  - Robot with IR sensors
  - Camera (for capturing video frames and processing ArUco markers)

### My Contributions: (Focus on Vision Part)
