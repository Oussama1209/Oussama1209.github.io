## Project Title: Rocket-Path-Simulation-MPC

### Brief Description:
This project revolves around the development of a Model Predictive Control (MPC) for a rocket prototype, aiming at finding optimal trajectory planning and robust control amidst model mismatches. It encompasses creating an MPC controller using MATLAB, leveraging tools like YALMIP, MPT3, Gurobi, and Casadi for simulation and control implementation.

### Technologies Used:
- **Programming Languages:** MATLAB
- **Tools & Libraries:** YALMIP, MPT3, Gurobi, Casadi
