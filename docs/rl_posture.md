## Project Title: Adaptive Posture Regulation with Visual Stimuli

### Brief Description:
Prolonged use of digital devices can lead to poor posture, resulting in various health issues. This project aimed to develop an adaptive posture regulation system that uses real-time monitoring and dynamic visual feedback to encourage healthier posture habits. The system was designed to continuously observe user posture and provide subtle visual prompts, using reinforcement learning algorithms to adapt to user behavior and promote regular posture changes.

### Technologies Used:
- **Programming Languages:** Python
- **Reinforcement Learning Algorithms:** Double Q-Learning, Expected SARSA

### My Contributions:
- **Design and Planning:**
  - Conceptualized and modeled the problem of adaptive posture regulation.
  - Identified and implemented the most effective reinforcement learning algorithms for this project.

- **Development:**
  - Developed the entire simulation environment to mimic real-world scenarios, incorporating factors like user fatigue and behavior variability.
  - Implemented and fine-tuned Double Q-Learning and Expected SARSA algorithms within the simulation.
  - Integrated noise and stochastic elements into the simulation to ensure robustness and realism.

- **Analysis:**
  - Conducted extensive testing of the implemented algorithms, analyzing their performance in terms of reward accumulation and stability.
  - Continuously refined the models to improve their adaptability to different user behaviors and conditions.

### Outcome/Impact:
The project demonstrated the potential of using reinforcement learning for posture regulation, with the developed system effectively adapting to user behavior and promoting healthier habits. The integration of dynamic visual stimuli with reinforcement learning algorithms provided a new approach to long-term posture management.
