## Project Title: Mobile-Robot-Navigation

### Project Overview:

The project focuses on creating an environment where a robot navigates through obstacles using global and local navigation techniques. The project involves navigating a robot through an obstacle-laden environment, where it must find and follow the optimal path to a target using only vision. It incorporates precise motion control and pose estimation through Kalman filtering and employs local navigation strategies to dynamically avoid undetected physical obstacles.

### Technologies Used:
- **Programming Languages:** Python

- **Frameworks/Libraries:**
  - ArUco Library (for marker detection)
  - OpenCV (for computer vision tasks)

- **Tools & Platforms:**
  - Jupyter Notebook (for documentation and report compilation)
  - Git (for version control and collaboration)

- **Sensors and Hardware:**
  - Robot with IR sensors
  - Camera (for capturing video frames and processing ArUco markers)

- **Design and Planning:**
  - Conceptualized the vision system for robot navigation.
  - Defined the vision system requirements and the integration approach with other system components.

- **Development and Modeling:**
  - Developed and implemented the vision algorithms for detecting and interpreting ArUco markers.
  - Integrated the vision system with the robot's navigation module to provide real-time positional data.
  - Analyzed the accuracy of the vision system in various environmental conditions.
  - Modeled the interaction between the vision system and the robot's movement to ensure cohesive operation.
